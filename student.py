You may modify this file however you wish, including creating additional
variables, functions, classes, etc., so long as your code runs with the
hw2main.py file unmodified, and you are only using the approved packages.

You have been given some default values for the variables stopWords,
wordVectors, trainValSplit, batchSize, epochs, and optimiser, as well as a basic
tokenise function.  You are encouraged to modify these to improve the
performance of your model.

The variable device may be used to refer to the CPU/GPU being used by PyTorch.
You may change this variable in the config.py file.

You may only use GloVe 6B word vectors as found in the torchtext package.

This code includes the input processing, neural network and loss function of the 
sentiment analysis program. The input processing functions are used to simplify the 
review data before it reaches the network by removing punctuation and any 
non-alphabetic characters. There is also a hardcoded list of stop words that are 
removed from each review to reduce noise. Each remaining word is converted to a 
GloVe vector of dimension 300. The network receives these sets of GLoVe vectors in 
batches of 32 and theyâ€™re processed by an LSTM layer. The LSTM is multilayered and 
bidirectional, meaning that it processes data both forwards and backwards (or left 
to right and right to left). The final hidden state of the LSTM is captured and fed 
forward through a dropout layer, and two separate output layers; one has a single 
output with sigmoid activation so that that the output is between 0 and 1, the other 
has 5 outputs with softmax activation so that it produces a set of probabilities that 
sum to 1. These are the rating and category outputs respectively. To calculate a loss 
for the given output, the binary cross entropy loss for the rating output and the cross 
entropy loss for the category output are summed. Finally, after the network is trained, 
the net output is converted to two numbers, a zero or one for the rating and an integer 
between 1 and 4 for the category. The network uses an Adam optimisation algorithm with 
a learning rate of 0.0006.

We decided early on to start with an LSTM approach rather than other forms of recurrent 
networks. We experimented with a convolutional network; the accuracy for our configuration 
was similar but more computationally expensive, so we defaulted back to an LSTM set up. 
We also had between 2 and 3 hidden layers in our model for a while, but found that the 
accuracy was unaffected when they were removed, so we deemed them unnecessary. We decided 
to switch the optimiser from SGD to Adam because we learnt that Adam was a widely used optimiser 
for natural language processing. After changing to an Adam optimiser, it was easier to experiment 
as we no longer had to modify the momentum parameter manually. We also found that our 
configuration was most accurate with a very small learning rate.
